# 1. Introduction

As a part of the one week Biohackathion 2019, we formed a working group on the Sars-CoV-2 receptors in animals.

Both the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 virion surfaces contain the spike glycoprotein (S protein) that mediates virus entry into cells [yan2020structural]. The S protein is cleaved into subunits S1 and S2 upon viral infection. The S1 subunit contains the receptor binding domain (RBD) that binds to the peptidase domain (PD) of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Recently, it has been shown that the $\alpha1$ and $\alpha2$ helices and the $\beta3$ and $\beta4$ antiparallel strands of the PD in ACE2 are involved in the binding of the RBD. The structurally important amino acid residues have also been found:

* Gln24
* Asp30
* His34
* Tyr41
* Gln42
* Met82
* Lys353
* Arg357
