# 1. Introduction

As a part of the one week Biohackathion 2019, we formed a working group on the Sars-CoV-2 receptors in animals.

Both the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 virion surfaces contain the spike glycoprotein (S protein) that mediates virus entry into cells [yan2020structural]. The S protein is cleaved into subunits S1 and S2 upon viral infection. The S1 subunit contains the receptor binding domain (RBD) that binds to the peptidase domain (PD) of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Recently, it has been shown that the $\alpha1$ and $\alpha2$ helices and the $\beta3$ and $\beta4$ antiparallel strands of the PD in ACE2 are involved in the binding of the RBD. The structurally important amino acid residues have also been found:

* Gln24 
* Asp30
* His34
* Tyr41
* Gln42
* Met82
* Lys353
* Arg357

Before the st



Recently, the ACE2 sequences from human (Homo sapiens), mouse (Mus musculus), Chinese rufous horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus sinicus), pangolin (Manis javanica), cat (Felis catus), dog (Canis lupus familiaris), ferret (Mustela putorius furo), hamster (Mesocricetus auratus), cow (Bos taurus), pig (Sus scrofa), rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus), and goat (Capra hircus) were analyzed for overall conservation [sun2020atlas]. Furthermore, the 31st and 253rd amino acids were shown to be conserved in all species except for mouse and rat. However, the comparative analysis did not take into account the latest structural information on Sars-CoV-2 and all critical residues, and the authors justified the high binding potential of ACE2 based on overall sequence similarity rather than critical resiudes. In addition, the analysis was only limited to 12 mammalian species, and by extending the analysis into all known mammalian ACE2 sequences would increase our knowledge on potential hosts and reservoirs of Sars-CoV-2.

Here, we analyze the conservation of ACE2 and TMPSS2
